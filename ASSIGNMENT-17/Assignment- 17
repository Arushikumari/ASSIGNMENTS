        The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in Toyama,
        Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. Turner Broadcasting System bought
        the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for an
        English-language release in the United States,[3] but cancelled it
        without explanation before broadcasting any episodes. In July 2013,
        Voyager Japan announced the manga would be released digitally in English
        via the Amazon Kindle e-book service.
